Abstract
This project report presents a comparison study of four supervised machine learning approaches to clasiify a restaurant's health. Evaluating a restaurant is important to keep a check on how it is performing and what improvements might be needed.  In this project, we start by creating a dataset by combining features from the yelp challenge dataset and the US Government health dataset available online for the city of Las Vegas, Nevada. We then fill in the missing data using user based collaborative filtering and web scraping. For classifcation of a restaurant to be healthy or unhealthy, we use Support Vector Machines, Linear SVC, Decision Trees and Adaboost with decision stumps. The Adaboost with decision stump approach significantly outperforms the remaining three algorithms on our curated dataset achieves a precision of bla and recall of bla.
